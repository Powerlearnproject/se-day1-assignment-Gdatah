Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the engineering principles, methods and tools used to develop and maintain high qualuty software systems. It deals with design, development, testing and maintaining software application


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968- the first NATO Software Engineering conference was held
1970's - some new methodologies were developed
1980's - the first computer aided software engineering tools was released (CASE)


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- defining the software purpose and scope. Planning involve uncovering the tasks at hand and strategize for effecient execution 
Requirement Analysis- Identify and record the precise requirements of the final users
Design- It involves building the framework. This is the link between the software's purpose and it's execution
Coding- When engineers and developers get down to business by converting the software design into tangible code
Testing- This involves thorough examination of the software for any bugs or gliches that might have slipped through during codin
Deployment- This is the time when it is presented to the users by pushing to the production environment. This phase involvesrolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to it's end users. 
Maintenance- This involves frequent software updates, implementing patches, ad fixing bugs


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has a fixed timeline, treats scope as the driver and calculate the consequential time and cost  while Agile is lot more flexible and accounts for experimenting with different directions 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer design and maintain software systems
Software developer gather and evaluate user feedback. 
They deploy programs, comply with project plans and industry standars
Software developer run and debug existing code to determine and solve errors
Quality Assurance Engineer in software engineering team prevents defects, they ensure that the software passes all checks before it is released to the public
Project Manager in software engineering team is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. 
They ensure that all tasks are completed on time and within budget 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs improves code accuracy
It boost productivity and efficiency, helps in code completion, suntax higlighting and error detection that can speed up the coding process
Version Control System (VCS) helps in detailed tracking 
VSC not only enables software developer to manage changes to code and files overtime, it also allows them to work on the same project simultaneously 



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Difficulty in maintenance
High modification cost
Inadequate performance
Difficulty in adapting to new technologies
Poor time management
To overcome challenges faced by software engineers, software engineers can make sure there is effective project management, utilize collaboration tools to foster team work. Work on platforms that allow seamless sharing of code and documentation


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - is when you test the smallest functional unit of the code to ensure code quality
Integration- is testing multiple parts of a software system. It test the inteface between two software units or modules 
system- system testing examines every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified whole
acceptance- is a quality assurance process that determines to what degree an application meets end users'approval 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process whereby you guide generative artificial intelligence solutions to generate the desired output. It is the process of guiding the AI and giving it a simplified instructions on what and what you want your output to be like.
AI interaction helps in enhancing core cognitive abilities and influences how we communicate

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is your opinion on this matter?

This can be improved by saying 
What do you think we can add to the program to make it well executed?
The improved prompt is more effective because it will give us a precise answer to a question and explain better
